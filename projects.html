    <p> I have extensive experience using Python and SQL to create visualizations and solutions that are grounded in empiracal evidence, which
  helps present answers in a convincing way. These are several of my projects, and each are attached with github links that contain the code for each. Provided below are sample
  outputs and visualizations for the specific projects.</p>

  <div id = "projects"

      <p>Utilizes HTML by scraping data from several NBA websites, recording scores and attendance of every NBA game from 2017-18 season. Stores data through SQL and implements Python to create several graphs which attempt to correlate team performance via home/away scoring totals with attendance.<p>

      <img src = "./images/darksky.jpg" alt = "Example output via terminal" title="Example output via terminal" class = "code" height = 250 width = 250>
      <p>Using Google and Dark SkyNet APIs, created an interactive chatbot that can give weather information for any city in the world. Example queries include ‘What’s the weather like in Ann Arbor today?’, ‘Is it going to rain in London this week?’, and ‘How hot will it get in Nashville this week?’<p>

      <img src = "./images/coffee_term.jpg" alt = "Terminal output from beans" title="Terminal output from beans" class = "code" height = 250 width = 250>
      <img src = "./images/bean.jpg" alt = "Database results from csv extraction" title="Database results from csv extraction" class = "code" height = 250 width = 500>
      <p>Using a CSV file that contains information regarding specific companies, cocoa bean flavors, cocoa percent and rating, amongst many others, I exported all data efficiently to SQL, making it easier to interpret. Through Python commands, I ranked companies based on average rating, and found which countries and companies exported the highest amount.<p>

      <img src = "./images/itunes.jpg" alt = "Output listing top matches from user input" title="Output listing top matches from user input" class = "code" height = 250 width = 250>
      <p>Created an interactive search interface using iTunes’ API, which prompts the user to enter a keyword or artist name, in which the program will fetch the top 50 iTunes matches for the input. The user is then able to launch a preview via web browser for a song, movie, or other media that coincides with the user input.<p>
