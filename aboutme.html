<article>
  <p>Welcome! My name is Thomas Bautista, and I was born in Detroit, Michigan, which initiated my love for all Michigan and Detroit athletics. When I was ten years old, I moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where I spent the rest of my childhood.</p>

  <p>My roots led me back to the University of Michigan, where I am currently a junior majoring in Information, with a focus in data analysis. I am interested in bridging the gap of computer science between the business and psychological realm. My technical skills include Python, SQL, HTML, and CSS, with which I have an innate ability to create digital solutions that offer information to stakeholders, and communication skills to be able to aptly portray my findings. Some of my existing projects are located in the <a href = "https://ttista.github.io/portfolio/projects/portfolio">Projects</a> section. In the summer of 2018, I was granted admission at the London School of Economics, in which I had the privilege of studying the Management and Economics of E-Business under Dr. Antonio Cordella, a cutting-edge researcher in the world of E-Business. Aside from school, I offer tutoring services in ACT Prep, Calculus, Algebra I and II, Chemistry, and Spanish. Before departing for London, I maintained twenty clients a week while developing action plans based on high school and middle school studentsâ€™ goals.</p>

  <p>Some of my interests include the aforementioned Michigan sports teams, golf, travelling, and advanced NBA statistics. I was fortunate enough to have visited the World Cup Semifinal in St. Petersburg, and watched Novak Djokovic vs Roger Federer in the Wimbledon Semifinal. I have visited eight countries, and plan on growing that passion as a means to further understand and accept different cultures across the world.</p>
